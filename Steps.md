## Week4

### Step 1
1. Install `react-router-dom` for managing routing in your application.
2. Create pages for `Root`, `Login`, `ErrorPage`, `List`, and `Form`.
3. Set up routes:
   - `Root` will contain the `Header`, `Outlet`, and `Footer` components.
4. Test your routes by entering different paths in the URL, such as:
   - `/login`
   - `/employees`
   - `/new`
   - `/something` (to verify that the `ErrorPage` displays correctly).

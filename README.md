# Employee Manager App

This projects goal was to build a simple SPA using Vit and React while learning the technology during the process.
### Goals:
- Create Vite Project
- Connect to Github
- Set up basic layout(fonts,colors,base CSS)
- Make EmployeeCard & EmployeeList components
- Add props to EmployeeCard
- Pass props to multiple EmployeeCard instances in EmployeeList
- Add State to EmployeeCard
    - Use state within EmployeeCard to manage the role, intitilizing it with the role passed in as a prop 
- Add role change button
- Define the onPromote function in EmployeeCard that checks the current role state:
    - If the role is "Team Leader" it changes the role back to the original role passed as a prop(e.g "Developer")

    - If the role is not "Team Leader", it sets it to "Team Leader"

    - Connect the onClickhandler fuction to the buttons onClick event
